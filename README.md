Chrome Extension to search ebooks on NYPL Overdrive

Clicking on the extension icon will display the books on NYPL Overdrive that match the author and title from the current tab displaying an Amazon kindle book.

Todo:

- Handle non-kindle titles.
- Change script to display the Overdrive titles in the amazon page rather than on the extension popup.
